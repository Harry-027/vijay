# Vijay: A Trustless Freelancing Platform on Solana

## Overview

Vijay is a decentralized freelancing platform built on the Solana blockchain. It introduces a new trustless protocol where clients and freelancers can collaborate on projects securely, without intermediaries. The platform leverages smart contracts to manage registration, project assignment, escrowed payments, and task validation.
It enables Clients and Freelancers to collaborate trustlessly using a milestone-based escrow system. Funds are securely held in program-controlled accounts and released on task approval, ensuring a transparent and secure freelancing experience.

## Smart Contract Overview

### Instructions

* `initializeState`: Sets the program owner so that owner can withdraw amount earned by program via client registeration.
* `initializeClient`: Creates client profile, deducts 1 SOL as regiteration fee.
* `initializeFreelancer`: Creates Freelancer profile. Free registration with skill metadata.
* `initializeProject`: Publishes a project with details.
* `projectEscrowSetup`: Assigns freelancer to a project.
* `requestTaskReview`: Freelancer submits task URL.
* `reviewTaskProcess`: Client either approves, releases per-task payment or rejects task (no payment).
* `transferProject`: Change assigned freelancer.
* `withdrawProject`: Closes project and refunds unspent budget.

### Accounts

* `State`
* `Client`
* `ClientReportCard`
* `Freelancer`
* `FreelancerReportCard`
* `Project`
* `Escrow`
* `Vault`
* `FreelancerProject`

## Escrow and Vault Logic

1. **Project Assignment**

   * Vault and escrow PDAs created
   * Full budget held in vault

2. **Task Approval**

   * Budget / total tasks = payout per task
   * Vault → Freelancer upon approval

3. **Project Completion**

   * Vault closed, escrow closed

4. **Early Termination**

   * Refund remaining SOL to Client
